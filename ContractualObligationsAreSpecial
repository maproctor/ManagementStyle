Basically everything in a business organization is flexible except contractual obligations.
While those are somewhat negotiable, the risks of not meeting them is practically never worth assuming.
While not worth assuming, you can always ask for negotiation or forgiveness at low or no cost.

This means that the only things we should consider rock solid are outside the team.
Everything on a team can change at any time, and should change if the value justifies the cost.

For obvious reasons, the value of violating laws never justifies the cost of violating cost.
The value of violating contractual obligations never justifies the cost of violating contractual obligations.

So we consider those things holy which are contractually obligated. Everything else is a matter of practice.

Tradition is often sacrificed on the alter of new legitimate administration.
